Mathematics is a fundamental subject in education that deals with the study of numbers, quantities, shapes, and patterns. Key branches include:

- Algebra: The study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols. It involves solving equations, inequalities, and understanding functions.

- Geometry: The branch of mathematics concerned with properties and relations of points, lines, surfaces, and solids. It includes concepts like area, volume, and theorems such as the Pythagorean theorem.

- Calculus: The mathematical study of continuous change. It has two main branches: differential calculus (rates of change) and integral calculus (accumulation).

- Statistics: The study of data collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation. It includes probability theory and statistical inference.

- Trigonometry: The study of relationships between the sides and angles of triangles, extended to general triangles and periodic functions.

Mathematics is essential for understanding the world and is used in various fields including science, engineering, economics, and technology.
The Grade 10 to Grade 12 Mathematics curriculum (often referred to as the FET Phase) focuses on building analytical, problem-solving, and abstract reasoning skills. It covers six core knowledge areas, with an emphasis on Functions, Calculus, and Analytical Geometry for the final years.
