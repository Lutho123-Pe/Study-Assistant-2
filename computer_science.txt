Computer Science is the study of computation, information, and automation. It encompasses the theory, design, development, and application of computer systems. Key areas include:

- Algorithms and Data Structures: The design and analysis of efficient methods for solving computational problems. Includes sorting, searching, graphs, and trees.

- Programming: Writing code in languages like Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. Covers syntax, logic, and best practices.

- Computer Systems: Hardware and software architecture, operating systems, networks, and databases.

- Artificial Intelligence: Machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing, and robotics.

- Software Engineering: Principles of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems.

- Cybersecurity: Protecting computer systems from threats, including encryption, authentication, and ethical hacking.

- Data Science: Analyzing and interpreting complex data sets using statistics, programming, and machine learning.

Computer Science education develops problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and prepares students for careers in technology and innovation.
