Indigenous Inhabitants of the Cape in the 17th Century (Revision)
The Cape was originally inhabited by three main groups:


San Hunter-Gatherers: The first people at the Cape, who were nomadic and survived by hunting wild animals and gathering plant foods. They believed the land belonged to the community. The Dutch called them 'Bushmen'.





Khoikhoi Herders (Pastoralists): They lived along the coastal regions and kept livestock (sheep and cattle), which were a measure of their wealth and status. Their lives revolved around water, animals, and land. The Dutch referred to them as 'Hottentots' (now considered insulting).




African Farmers (Xhosa): Xhosa tribes settled in the Eastern Cape (Transkei and Ciskei), planting crops like sorghum and millet and owning large herds of cattle, which were a form of wealth. Their arrival led to clashes with European farmers over land.




2. Dutch Settlement and Colonisation (1652 onwards)

Reason for Settlement: The DEIC (Dutch East India Company) / VOC established a permanent settlement at the Cape in 1652 to create a half-way refreshment station for their long trade voyages between Europe and the East. This was necessary to supply sailors with fresh fruit and vegetables to prevent 

scurvy (caused by a lack of Vitamin C).


Arrival: Jan van Riebeeck arrived in April 1652.


Early Development: The settlers built a fort (later replaced by the Castle of Good Hope), the Company Gardens to grow food, a harbour, workshops, and medical centers.



Free Burghers and Expansion: The VOC allowed some employees to set up their own farms, calling them 'Boers' (farmers). As the settlement grew and needed more land, conflict with the indigenous people began, leading to the process of 

colonisation.


Robben Island: Used by Van Riebeeck's men for livestock and hunting. Over 400 years, it was also used as a hospital, military base, and (from 1961-1991) a maximum-security prison for political prisoners like 

Nelson Mandela.

3. Slavery at the Cape

Reasons for Slavery: The Dutch were forbidden to enslave local people. However, the growing settlement needed more workers. The local 


Khoikhoi were unreliable because they prioritised their cattle and grew to distrust the Dutch. The DEIC decided to bring in slaves from elsewhere.




Origin of Slaves: Slaves came mainly from countries along the Indian Ocean trade route, including Angola, Mozambique, Madagascar, India, and the East Indies.


Timeline: Approximately 63,000 slaves were brought to the Cape by 1808. 

Emancipation (freeing) of slaves occurred in 1834.


Slave Work: Slaves performed almost all skilled work in the city (e.g., bricklayers, carpenters, tailors) and manual labor on farms (e.g., ploughing, harvesting wheat, viticulture/winemaking).



Resistance: Slaves were controlled strictly, facing harsh punishments. Two major uprisings occurred in the early 1800s, including the 

1808 Rebellion led by Lois, which aimed for freedom but was defeated.




Legacy: Slaves made enormous cultural contributions to the Cape, seen in Cape Dutch architecture, the distinctive Cape Malay cuisine (e.g., bobotie, samoosas), and the Cape Minstrel Carnival. They also brought the 



religion of Islam.


Afrikaans Language: The need for a common language among the multilingual slaves led them to learn Dutch, adding words from their own languages, which became the foundation of Afrikaans.

4. Expanding European Frontiers

Trek Boers: Settlers known as Trek Boers moved inland in the late 1600s and 1700s, seeking fresh grazing land and independence from the DEIC's rule. They were tough, poorly educated, and very religious, calling their adventurous spirit 


'trek gees'.



Conflict and Dispossession: The Trek Boers' expansion led to constant conflict with the Khoikhoi and Xhosa. The Trek Boers' superior 

weapons resulted in the dispossessed Khoikhoi being killed or forced into servitude.


Consequences: Within 60 years of the Dutch arrival, the traditional social, economic, and political order of the Khoikhoi was nearly destroyed. Additionally, many Khoikhoi died from outbreaks of 

smallpox and measles. The Trek Boers' hunting practices also led to the extinction of animals like the 

blauwbok and quagga.


Mission Stations: Genadendal was founded in 1738 as the first mission station in southern Africa, teaching the Khoikhoi to read and write.


Preserving Heritage: The work of Lucy Lloyd and Wilhelm Bleek in the 19th century created an archive of over 13,000 documents that preserve the memory of the now 'lost' 
ÓÄ†
=Xam and !Kung (Khoisan) languages.
South African history typically taught from Grade 7 through Grade 12.

1. Early Inhabitants and Pre-Colonial Societies (Grade 7) üó∫Ô∏è
San: The earliest inhabitants, known as hunter-gatherers with a nomadic lifestyle and deep spiritual connection to the land.

Khoikhoi: Pastoralists (herders) who owned livestock (cattle and sheep) and lived in patrilineal groups. The Dutch referred to them as 'Hottentots'.

African Farming Communities: Settled in the east and south-east (e.g., Nguni, Sotho-Tswana), practising mixed farming (crops like sorghum and millet, and cattle). Their social structures were based on chiefdoms and communal land ownership.

2. The Colonial Period: 17 
th
 ‚Äì19 
th
  Centuries (Grade 7 & 10) ‚öì
Dutch Rule (1652‚Äì1806)
Establishment: The Dutch East India Company (VOC) established a refreshment station at the Cape in 1652 under Jan van Riebeeck to supply passing ships.

Expansion and Conflict: The granting of land to Free Burghers (settlers) led to expansion and the first Khoikhoi-Dutch Wars, resulting in the dispossession and destruction of Khoikhoi society, exacerbated by smallpox epidemics.

Slavery: To meet labor demands, the VOC imported thousands of slaves primarily from the Indian Ocean region (India, Indonesia, Madagascar, Mozambique). Slaves formed the backbone of the Cape economy and contributed to the development of Cape Malay culture and the Afrikaans language.

The Trek: Trek Boers moved inland during the 18th century seeking grazing land and independence from VOC control, leading to continuous conflict with indigenous groups.

British Rule and Frontier Wars
British Occupation (1806): The British formally took control of the Cape.

Abolition of Slavery (1834): The British abolished slavery, which angered many Dutch farmers.

The Mfecane/Difaqane: A period of widespread warfare, migration, and political re-alignment in the interior of Southern Africa in the early 19th century, often attributed to both internal conflict (under Shaka Zulu) and external pressures (slave trade, European expansion).

The Great Trek (1836 onwards): Thousands of disgruntled Dutch farmers (Voortrekkers) migrated inland, leading to violent clashes with the Ndebele, Zulu, and Sotho communities, and the eventual formation of independent Boer Republics (Transvaal and Orange Free State).

3. Industrialisation and Segregation (Grade 10 & 11) ‚õèÔ∏è
Mineral Revolution: The discovery of diamonds (Kimberley, 1867) and gold (Witwatersrand, 1886) transformed the economy.

Economic Change: This led to rapid industrialisation, mass urbanisation, the demand for cheap labour, and the concentration of land and wealth in white hands.

Labour Control: Laws were introduced to control and confine black labour (compounds, pass laws, low wages), marking the start of institutionalised segregation.

South African War (Anglo-Boer War, 1899‚Äì1902): A brutal conflict between the British and the two Boer Republics over control of resources and political power. It resulted in the use of scorched-earth tactics and concentration camps for Boer women and children, but also for Black people.

Foundation of the Union
Union of South Africa (1910): The four British colonies (Cape, Natal, Transvaal, and Orange Free State) merged to form a self-governing dominion under the British Empire. This union was built on racial exclusion, limiting political rights primarily to white men.

Land Act (1913): The cornerstone of territorial segregation, which restricted land ownership by black people to only about 7% of the country (later expanded to 13%).

4. Resistance, Apartheid, and the Transition (Grade 11 & 12) ‚úä
Early Resistance and Mobilisation
ANC Formation (1912): The South African Native National Congress (later the African National Congress) was formed to challenge racist legislation.

Communist Party (CPSA): Active in promoting workers' rights and anti-racism.

Defiance Campaign (1952): The ANC, along with other groups, launched large-scale non-violent resistance against unjust laws.

The Apartheid State (1948‚Äì1994)
1948 Election: The National Party (NP) won on the platform of Apartheid (Afrikaans for 'apartness').

Core Legislation: Apartheid was enforced through laws like the Population Registration Act (racial classification), the Group Areas Act (forced removal and residential segregation), and the Bantu Education Act (inferior schooling for black children).

Sharpeville Massacre (1960): Police opened fire on protestors demonstrating against pass laws, killing 69 people. This led to the banning of the ANC and PAC, and the transition of the liberation movements to the armed struggle (Umkhonto we Sizwe - MK).

Imprisonment: Key leaders, including Nelson Mandela, were sentenced to life imprisonment following the Rivonia Trial (1964).

Height of Resistance and State Repression
Black Consciousness Movement (BCM): Led by Steve Biko, this movement empowered black people through self-reliance and psychological liberation in the 1970s.

Soweto Uprising (1976): Students protested the mandatory use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction, resulting in mass violence and a turning point in the struggle.

Internal and External Pressure: Increasing international isolation (sanctions, boycotts) and growing internal unrest (trade unions, United Democratic Front - UDF) made the country ungovernable by the late 1980s.

Transition to Democracy
F.W. de Klerk's Reforms (1990): De Klerk unbanned liberation movements, released Nelson Mandela, and began repealing key apartheid laws.

CODESA/Multi-party negotiations (1991‚Äì1993): Negotiations for a democratic constitution, often complicated by political violence.

First Democratic Election (1994): South Africa held its first non-racial democratic elections. Nelson Mandela became the first president.

Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC): Established to investigate human rights abuses during the apartheid era, offering amnesty in exchange for truth, in an effort to promote national unity and healing.
