Economics is the social science that studies how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies allocate scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It examines production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. Key concepts include:

- Microeconomics: The study of individual economic units such as households, firms, and markets. Includes supply and demand, elasticity, and market structures.

- Macroeconomics: The study of the economy as a whole. Covers inflation, unemployment, GDP, fiscal and monetary policy.

- Economic Systems: Capitalism, socialism, mixed economies, and their characteristics.

- International Economics: Trade, globalization, exchange rates, and international organizations like the WTO.

- Development Economics: Economic growth, poverty reduction, and sustainable development.

- Behavioral Economics: How psychological factors influence economic decisions.

Economics education develops analytical skills, understanding of market dynamics, and informed decision-making in personal and professional contexts.
